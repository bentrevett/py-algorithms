But now that so many people have chimneys, maybe he could sneak in that way?\" Another voice responds, \"Actually, we've been working on a new kind of suit that would let him fit through tight spaces like that. But, I heard that a few days ago, they lost the prototype fabric, the design plans, everything! Nobody on the team can even seem to remember important details of the project!\"\n",
